                      * OVERVIEW
                      
                      Plugins are simple JAR files with classes that would implement certain plugin interfaces. 
                      In this application, plugins wll be used in "savings" as I am not sure about types of
                      "savings" possible. Savings plugin will basically provide the following:
                      a) UI tile to display a "savings" form:
                         public JComponent getAddUI() - an empty UI form to add the type of saving
                         
                      b) UI tile to display a "savings" data:
                         public JComponent getEditUI(Map data) - a UI form to show savings detail
                                - this must make use of (recommended)
                                public Map DataUtils.loadSavingsDetail(String id) - that will return
                                a map of key-values related to the saving. The key of the Map will be based on
                                what was used while adding the savings information using following API:
                      c) Save 'Savings' information:
                         public Map getSavingsData() - API to get Savings information on map.
                                This would return savings data displayed on the UI Component.
                      d) Delete 'Savings' information:
                         public boolean delete(String key) - removes savings information from datastore.
